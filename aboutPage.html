                <p>Hello, my name is Joe. I am currently taking course in a Web Development Bootcamp run by HyperionDev. To showcase what I have learned so far, I have created this website.</p>

                <p>I have loved playing video games all my life and enjoyed the experiences that they have brought me. To show of this hobby a bit I created this website as a way of providing some information so that someone who is just looking at getting into gaming can be provided with some background and opinions on the current popular choices.</p>

                <h2>My links</h2>

                <p>If you wish, feel free to look at my current portfolio in my <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/115817/">course</a> or look at some of the projects I have completed whilst self-learning in my <a href="https://github.com/Grattade07">Github</a></p>
