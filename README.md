# My gaming Website (Bootcamp Capstone Project)

This project is a multi-page website that I created during my bootcamp at HyperionDev using *HTML, CSS and Javascript*. The website's topic is gaming, it goes over a couple of the most popular options for gaming consoles, giving a short history of each and detailing the most popular games plus some pro's and con's of each console. The website makes use of the user's localStorage to create a functional "Saved for later page".

Each console section has some information and two buttons. The like button is cosmetic whilst the save for later button is used to save the chosen section to the "Save for Later" page. It will alert you about how many articles you have saved.
